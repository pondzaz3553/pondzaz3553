## Hi everyone! Welcome to my space :world: ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and developing my skills on SQL, R, Python, and Tableau

Data has become one of the most favorite areas that I'm seeking to proficiency in the future. Explore data is like searching for treasures. It's difficult and full-filled with obstacles and challenges but it's fun when you accomplished your goals :)

I will use this space for taking note on my data journey,practicing skills, and knowing more people! so please do not hesitate to contact me :blush:
