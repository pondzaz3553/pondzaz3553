## Hi everyone! Welcome to my space 🌏 
🌱 I’m currently learning and developing my skills on SQL, R, Python, and Tableau

🍀 Data has become one of the most favorite areas that I'm seeking to proficiency in the future. Explore data is like searching for treasures. It's difficult and full-filled with obstacles and challenges but it's fun when you accomplished your goals :)

🌟 I will use this space for taking note on my data journey, practicing skills, and getting know more people! so please do not hesitate to contact me :blush:
